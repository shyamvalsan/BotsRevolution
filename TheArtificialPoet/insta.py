Haiku by Kobayashi Issa 

Dew evaporates
And all our world 
is dew
So dear,
So fresh, 
So fleeting

Kobayashi Issa (1763â€“1828) was a Japanese poet and lay Buddhist priest known for his haiku poems and journals. He is better known as simply Issa, a pen name meaning Cup-of-tea. He is regarded as one of the four haiku masters in Japan, along with Basho, Buson and Shiki.

He lost two children at a young age, and many of his poems reflect the sorrow and fleeting nature of our existence.
